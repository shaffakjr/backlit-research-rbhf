## About
The proposed RBHF technique enhances a single backlit or low-light image
Using region-based histogram specification & DWT image fusion. The algorithm corrects exposure disparities in captured photos and results in no colour distortion or artefacts. Multiple iterations can improve enhancement quality, significantly. Unsharp masking can be applied to the final output to sharpen image.
